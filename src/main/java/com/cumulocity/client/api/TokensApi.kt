	/**
	 * Create a notification token
	 * 
	 * Create a new JWT (JSON web token) access token which can be used to establish a successful WebSocket connection to read a sequence of notifications.
	 * 
	 * In general, each request to obtain an access token consists of:
	 * 
	 * * The subscriber name which the client wishes to be identified with.
	 * * The subscription name. This value must be associated with a subscription that's already been created and in essence, the obtained token will give the ability to read notifications for the subscription that is specified here.
	 * * The token expiration duration.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ##### Required roles
	 * 
	 *  ROLE_NOTIFICATION_2_ADMIN 
	 * 
	 * ##### Response Codes
	 * 
	 * The following table gives an overview of the possible response codes and their meanings:
	 * 
	 * * HTTP 200 A notification token was created.
	 * * HTTP 401 Authentication information is missing or invalid.
	 * * HTTP 403 Not enough permissions/roles to perform this operation.
	 * * HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity â€“ invalid payload.
	 * 
	 * @param body
	 * @param xCumulocityProcessingMode
	 * Used to explicitly control the processing mode of the request. See [Processing mode](#processing-mode) for more details.

	/**
	 * Unsubscribe a subscriber
	 * 
	 * Unsubscribe a notification subscriber using the notification token.
	 * 
	 * Once a subscription is made, notifications will be kept until they are consumed by all subscribers who have previously connected to the subscription. For non-volatile subscriptions, this can result in notifications remaining in storage if never consumed by the application.They will be deleted if a tenant is deleted. It can take up considerable space in permanent storage for high-frequency notification sources. Therefore, we recommend you to unsubscribe a subscriber that will never run again.
