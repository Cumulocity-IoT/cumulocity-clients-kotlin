	 * 
	 * Only those devices which are registered to use cert auth can authenticate via mTLS protocol and retrieve JWT token. Device access token API works only on port 8443 via mutual TLS (mTLS) connection.Immediate issuer of client certificate must present in Platform's truststore, if not then whole certificate chain needs to send in header and root or any intermediate certificate must be present in the Platform's truststore.We must have the following:
	 * 
	 * * private_key
	 * * client certificate
	 * * whole certificate chain (Optional - This API requires the client to send a custom header `X-SSL-CERT-CHAIN` only if the immediate issuer of the client's certificate is not uploaded as a trusted certificate on the platform. If the immediate issuer is already uploaded and trusted, the header can be omitted)

	 * ##### Response Codes
	 * 
	 * The following table gives an overview of the possible response codes and their meanings:
	 * 
	 * * HTTP 200 Successfully retrieved device access token from device certificate.
	 * * HTTP 400 Unable to parse certificate chain.
	 * * HTTP 401 One or more certificates in the chain are revoked or the certificate chain is not valid. Revoked certificates are checked first, then the validity of the certificate chain.
	 * * HTTP 404 Device access token feature is disabled.
	 * * HTTP 422 The verification was not successful.
	 * 
	 * @param xSslCertChain
	 * Used to send a certificate chain in the header. Separate the chain with ` ` (a space character) and also each 64 bit block with ` ` (a space character).
